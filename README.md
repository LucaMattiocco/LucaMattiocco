# 👋 Hi, I'm Luca Mattiocco

I am a highly motivated engineer with a strong passion for **aerodynamics** and the **Aerospace Industry**. I recently completed my MSc Thesis, where I focused on using the **Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)** method to quantify uncertainties in waverider designs.

## 🎓 Education
- **Double MSc** in **Aerospace Computational Engineering** from **Cranfield University** with an emphasis on **CFD** and **Aerodynamics** and **ISAE-Supméca**, specializing in **Mechanical Engineering** and **Numerical Techniques**.

## 👨‍💻 Professional Interests
I am actively seeking opportunities as a:
- **CFD Engineer**
- **Application Engineer**
- **Validation & Verification Engineer**
- **CFD Software Developer**

While I have a strong passion for **aerodynamics** and the **aerospace** industry, I am open to exploring roles in various fields where **CFD** can be applied. 

## 🔧 Skills & Expertise
- **CFD Simulations** (Unsteady Flows, Hypersonic Flows)
- **Aerodynamics** (Vehicle and External Aerodynamics)
- **Uncertainty Quantification** using **Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)** and **Mesh Validation**
- **Software Development** for CFD tools using **Python** and **C++**
- **Hypersonic Waverider Design**

## 📫 How to reach me
Feel free to contact me at:
- Email (preferred): **luca.mattiocco@orange.f**
- Secondary email: **luca.mattiocco@cranfield.ac.uk**

I am eager to bring my knowledge and skills to a dynamic and innovative team in the CFD field!
