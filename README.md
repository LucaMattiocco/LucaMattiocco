# üëã Hi, I'm Luca Mattiocco

I am a highly motivated engineer with a strong passion for **aerodynamics** and the **Aerospace Industry**. I recently completed my MSc Thesis, where I focused on using the **Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)** method to quantify uncertainties in waverider designs (Hypersonics Aircraft).

## üéì Education
- **Double MSc** in **Aerospace Computational Engineering** from **Cranfield University** with an emphasis on **CFD** and **Aerodynamics** and **ISAE-Supm√©ca**, specializing in **Mechanical Engineering** and **Numerical Techniques**.

## üîß Skills & Expertise
- **Aero and Fluid Dynamics**: Strong foundation in **aerodynamic principles**, focusing on **stability**, **control**, and **external vehicle aerodynamics**.
  
- **CFD Simulations**: Expertise in **hypersonic flows** and **aerodynamic analysis** using **STAR-CCM+** and **ANSYS Fluent**. Skilled in both **steady** and **unsteady simulations** with an emphasis on **flow control** for hypersonic vehicles and other aerospace applications.

- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Implemented **Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)** to validate and quantify uncertainties in **CFD simulations**.

- **Meshing Techniques**: Experienced with **rotating meshes**, **mesh quality checks**, and achieving **mesh convergence** using **GCI methods** (Roache and Celik).

- **Software Development**: Developed and automated **CFD workflows** using **Python** and **C++**, with experience in building custom libraries for uncertainty quantification and simulation automation.

- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Proficient in utilizing HPC systems for running large-scale **CFD simulations** efficiently.

- **Post-Processing**: Skilled in post-processing simulation data using a variety of tools, including:
  - **MATLAB**
  - **Python** (e.g., Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy)
  - **ParaView**
  - **Tecplot**

## üíº Career Interests
I am actively seeking opportunities as a:
- **CFD Engineer**
- **Application Engineer**
- **Verification & Validation Engineer**
- **CFD Software Developer**

While I am passionate about **aerodynamics** and **CFD** applied to **aerospace** and **automotive** sectors, I am open to other industries where my skills in **simulation** and **uncertainty quantification** can be valuable.

## üìù Projects
- **MSc Thesis - Flow Control for Hypersonic Vehicles**: Developed and automated **CFD workflows** for hypersonic flow control using **STAR-CCM+** and integrated uncertainty quantification via **Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)**.

- **Group Project - Onboard Weather Situation Awareness System**: Designed and coded pathfinding processes using **Python**, applying algorithms such as **Dijkstra's**, **K-means**, and **Delaunay's triangulation** to enhance pilot situational awareness.
